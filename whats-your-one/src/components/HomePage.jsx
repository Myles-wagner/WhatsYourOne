          Welcome to <strong>What's Your One?</strong> â€” a fun way to discover your true favorites 
          by making simple choices. Instead of ranking everything at once, you'll be shown items in small 
          batches and pick the ones you prefer.

        <p>
          Through this process of elimination, we'll help you discover what you truly love most. 
          Your choices are saved as you go, so you can take your time.
